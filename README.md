## 🔍 Key Insights

- Top Revenue Driver: The Thai Chicken Pizza is the primary revenue engine, generating $43,434.25 (5.31% of total revenue).
- Volume Leader: The Classic Deluxe Pizza is the most frequently ordered item with 2,453 units sold.
- Peak Demand Hours: Orders reach their absolute peak at 12:00 PM with 2,520 orders, followed by a second surge at 6:00 PM (18:00) with 2,399 orders.
- Lunch vs. Dinner Value: The Lunch time slot (11 AM – 2 PM) is the most lucrative, generating $322,080.80 in revenue.
- Spending Trends: Average Order Value (AOV) is higher during the lunch rush ($44.40 at noon) than during the dinner rush ($37.22 at 6 PM).
- Underperforming Items: The Brie Carre Pizza and The Green Garden Pizza are the lowest revenue generators, both falling significantly below the top-tier average.

## 📈 Business Recommendations

- Prioritize High-Value Inventory: Ensure a robust supply chain for Thai Chicken and Barbecue Chicken ingredients, as these items are critical to total revenue percentage.
- Optimize Peak Staffing: Increase kitchen and delivery staff specifically between 11:30 AM and 1:30 PM to manage the highest volume and highest AOV period of the day.
- Implement Evening Upselling: Introduce "Dinner Family Bundles" or appetizer pairings to increase the dinner AOV, which currently lags behind lunch spending by approximately 16%.
- Bridge the Mid-Day Gap: Launch "Happy Hour" promotions between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM to incentivize orders during the sharpest volume decline.
- Menu Rationalization: Consider removing or rebranding the bottom 5 pizzas by revenue to reduce inventory complexity and focus operations on high-demand items.
