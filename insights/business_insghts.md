# 📊 Business Insights & Recommendations

## Key Findings

- Revenue Concentration: Revenue is heavily concentrated in a few "superstar" items, with the top 10 pizzas each contributing between 3.78% and 5.31% of total revenue.
- Top Performer: The Thai Chicken Pizza is the primary revenue driver, earning $43,434.25, likely due to a premium price point as it ranks 5th in volume but 1st in value.
- Peak Demand: The absolute busiest time for the business is 12:00 PM, recording 2,520 orders.
- Lunch Dominance: The Lunch window (11 AM – 2 PM) is the most profitable time slot, generating $322,080.80 in revenue.
- AOV Disparity: Lunch orders are more valuable than dinner orders; the Average Order Value (AOV) at noon is $44.40, compared to $37.22 at 6:00 PM.
- Menu Underperformers: Low-revenue pizzas like The Brie Carre and The Green Garden generate significantly less than half the revenue of top-tier items.

## Recommendations

- Ensure Ingredient Availability: Prioritize the supply chain for Thai Chicken, Barbecue Chicken, and Classic Deluxe ingredients, as these items represent a massive portion of total earnings.
- Optimize Dinner AOV: Launch "Evening Bundle" offers (adding appetizers or drinks) to raise the dinner AOV, which currently lags behind lunch spending.
- Strategic Staffing: Maximize kitchen and delivery staff between 11:30 AM and 1:30 PM to handle the primary volume peak and protect the highest revenue window.
- Targeted Off-Peak Promos: Introduce "Happy Hour" discounts between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM to bridge the gap between the lunch and dinner rushes.
- Menu Pruning: Evaluate removing the bottom 5 revenue-generating pizzas to reduce inventory costs and streamline kitchen operations.
